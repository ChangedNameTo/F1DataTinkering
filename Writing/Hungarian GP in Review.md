The Good
Verstappen Domination Continues
Max continues his domination streak with yet another victory, his 7th in a row and the 9th of the season. If Max were a constructor, he would singlehandedly be winning the constructors championship as well. It’s actually absurd how good of a season he’s having, and it truly shows no sign of slowing down. From lap 25 to 43, Max did not have a single lap slower than Lando, and from lap 35 on (save 38) was gaining >1.0 seconds per lap as Landos tires fall off. Just an absolutely incredible stint from our current world champion.
New Qualifying Format
This segment was originally called “Alfa Romeo Q3 Surprise,” but I now feel as though I should withdraw that accolade. That said, the new qualifying format was absolutely electric. FOM has managed, against all odds, to deliver a quality format change that displayed different driver skills than we normally see, and set the record for the closest top ten ever. Nice work.
Ricciardo’s Tire Management
In the time since the last GP, Daniel is back on the grid and was widely considered to be the biggest question mark of the weekend. As a self admitted hater during the 2022 season, I’m happy to see him return to the form everyone hoped for and expected out of him. Given that the Alpha Tauri is easily among the worst cars on the grid, P13 after the collision with Zhou and Gasly is a fantastic finish for the Australian. In this house, we love tire whisperers, and Daniel took the C2 40 laps. This is the first time this season that Yuki has been beaten, and while that was largely due to some classic Alpha Tauri incompetence, let’s give credit where due.

The Bad
Zhou Rolls Worst Start Ever; Asks Alpines to Leave
After lining up on the grid in P5 for his best start of his career thus far, Zhou manages to put the car into anti-stall as soon as the lights go out. His start already ruined, he attempts to get his foot down and recoup his spots into Turn 1. Anyone who’s played iRacing knows how this next part goes. Zhou, taking all the wrong leads from his teammate, slams into the back of Ricciardo, collecting Gasly and Ocon in the process. Please return to pit lane, collect 5 seconds and 2 penalty points, thank you.
Ferrari Strategy, Charles Leclerc, and Xavi
Another weekend, another poor performance from the prancing ponies. It's getting to be agonizing with how many failed strategies this team continues to run, and Ferrari remains a team to have the race strategy dictated to them rather than carving positions out of nothing. Slow stops can happen to anyone, but this ruined Charles's race. I don't really understand why Xavi is still his engineer. He and Charles seem to have no report, Xavi sounds confused on the radio and Leclerc was despondent when stuck behind Carlos.
After losing 7 seconds on pit road, Ferrari plants him behind Carlos from lap 18 to 43. At no point during this stint was Charles more than 5 seconds behind Carlos. After undercutting his teammate, Charles immediately gaps him beyond 5 seconds. It’s agonizing. I want to like this team, but every weekend they do this! Every weekend!
Kevin Magnussen’s Qualifying Record
I never expect much from the Haas given that they never seem to expect much either, but KMag’s qualifying results as of late have been especially poor. Magnussen’s Q1 exits nearly equal Hulk’s Q3 appearances (6 to 5). The Haas continues to chew through tires me through Chex Mix, but at least Hulkenburg can use his top 10 starts to finish outside the bottom 5. It’s no surprise given this fact that there are rumors Haas will be extending Niko’s contract soon, with no such luck for Kevin. Outside of the 3 race stint of Baku, Miami, and Monaco, Kevin hasn’t outqualified Niko on a conventional racetrack.

The Ugly
Perez Qualifying Performance
I’m tired of talking about Checo. P9 in the RB19 is unacceptable.
The Steiner/Tost Hate Column
Or Why I Learned To Stop Worrying and Love the Pit Stop
Another race weekend behind us, and Haas has yet again disappointed any Americans who foolishly finished DTS last weekend and thought the team was any good. I am a long time Gunther hater, and this weekend was no exception. Pit stops are required every weekend, and it kills me to watch week after week of suboptimal stop times from our backmarkers. I’m a big believer in intentionality and doing the little things correctly, and slow stops are the F1 equivalent of high turnover percentages in football and basketball. Every week you’re going to need to do at least one pit stop, and accepting that there are going to be knowledge gaps between these teams, pit stops require relatively little to excel at.Yuki now inherits a negative storyline based on his finishing position entirely gifted by the Alpha Tauri pit crew. Is it any surprise that the teams at the back of the grid also have the slowest pit stops?
Let’s talk about strategy. When your car doesn’t have the ability to overtake on track, getting stuck in a DRS train will cripple your race. This is of course why Haas pits KMag early on lap 14, sticking him into a DRS train. Gunther loves this early pitstop. Granted, KMag’s times were already falling off, even though this is the same medium Ricciardo will take 40 laps. I digress. Haas then leaves KMag out until lap 41, after everyone finishes undercutting him.
Alpine’s Luck
In Silverstone, this same header made an appearance underneath “The Bad” chyron, so I guess this is improvement for the troubled French team?
The worst of their fears have been realized: McLaren has legitimate pace. Lando takes the 2nd step on the podium on pure merit, and Piastri has a learning experience for a GP with a P5 finish for him. He will surely get on the podium this season with this pace (assuming he can find a way to beat his teammate), and its tough to see what Alpine will manage to do to reel things back in.

The Forgettable
Aston Martin
This team has disappeared over the last few weeks, failing to get above 5th in the last 3 races. With Monaco as their last podium, Aston is now looking like the 4th/5th fastest team on the grid. Stroll continues to under perform, and Alonso sat in a race all by himself for quite some time.
